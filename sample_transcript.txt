This is "Tech & Life Cafe," and I'm your host, Takuya.
And I'm your co-host, Rena! Hey Takuya, I recently found an interesting interview video from overseas, but the English was so fast I could barely catch half of it...
Oh, I totally get that. Especially with technical topics, it's hard to even keep up with the subtitles. But I found an amazing app that solves that exact problem. It's called "interview2jppodcast"!
"Interview to Japanese Podcast"? So, just like the name says, it turns interviews into Japanese podcasts?
Exactly! With this app, as long as you have the transcript from an overseas interview, you can "listen" to it just like a Japanese radio show.
Wow, how does that work?
First, the amazing thing about this app is that it doesn't just translate the foreign transcript. It actually separates the voices for each speaker and turns it into a natural-sounding Japanese conversation.
Wow! It even does speaker separation? That's great, because with a mixed block of text, you'd lose track of who's talking.
That's right. And the one reading the Japanese translation is Google's latest AI, "Gemini." So it doesn't sound robotic at all; it's natural, like you're listening to real people talk.
Gemini! You can definitely expect high quality then. But for a long interview, like an hour, doesn't it take a long time to create the audio file?
Good question. That's another incredible feature of this app. It splits the long transcript into smaller "chunks" and processes them all at once in parallel with multiple AIs. It uses a technology called GraphAI, and thanks to that, even long interviews can be converted to audio in no time.
I see! So it's fast because it splits the work and does it all at once. That's smart!
And that's not all. It even has a feature to mix in your favorite BGM with the finished audio. So you can play your favorite music in the background and enjoy it just like a real podcast.
Amazing! So that means I can listen to that video I couldn't understand as a Japanese podcast during my commute!
Exactly! With "interview2jppodcast," you can absorb interesting information from around the world without worrying about language barriers. It makes the latest global information much more accessible.
That's groundbreaking! I'm going to try it right away!
